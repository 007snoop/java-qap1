> 1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

+ This took me about a week in full, I took time to really deep dive into what I was writing.



> 2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

+ I used ChatGPT to help me understand concepts a little easier, I used w3schools as a knowledge resource as well as a syntax DB.



> 3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

+ No, I did not require the help of anyone for this assignment. 



> 4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

+ Yes, I had IDE issues, however, most issues (code related & IDE) I was able to solve on my own.



> 5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

+ #1 was the hardest but I also went a little overboard with it and tried to learn as much as possible. Once I found my flow, #2 and #3 became very trivial.
